I think that the difference between data science and statistics is in the tools, 
the technique, and how easily their results can be interpreted by the general public. 
Data science requires the use of some programming language to manipulate massive data 
sets. Whereas statistical methods can be practiced by hand. An R script or SAS code can 
appear cryptic to a trained statistician with no experience in programming. Also, the 
products of data science are more easily digestible to the public. Anyone can look at 
a map developed in Tableau and derive some meaning from it, even if they have no training 
in data science nor statistics. On the other hand, statistics requires some knowledge of 
concepts like z-scores, t-statistics, and QQ-plots in order to read a white paper and 
interpret the results.

I personally lean more towards data science because I prefer the simplicity and 
sophistication of programming languages over the "nebulous" concpets related to
statistics.
